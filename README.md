INFSCI 2591 Algorithm Design

Written in Java, including four projects and quizzes.

Project description:
Project1:
1. Given an array, which is composed of two non-decreasing subarrays. The length of two subarrays are m and n respectively and m is greater than n. Implement an algorithm to output an array in non-decreasing order by merging the two subarrays. (You can create at most one array to help you solve the problem and the length of the array is smaller or equal to n).
2. Implement Ala Carte Multiplication algorithm and Rectangle Multiplication algorithm to multiply two large integers.

Project2:
	Implement shortest path problem using Dijkstra’s algorithm and Floyd’s algorithm implemented by two-dimensional array and linked list respectively. Report memory usages and running time for each algorithm implemented by each data structure.

Project3:
	1. Merge two city map datasets together and implement Kruskal’s Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree using two-dimensional array and linked list respectively. 
	2. Implement k-means algorithm to calculate losses for electric power consumption dataset by assigning different amount of cluster centroids.

Project4:
	1. Design an algorithm to find top 20 crowded crossings in a city map dataset.
	2. Implement traveling salesperson problem using dynamic programming and branch-and-bound implemented by two-dimensional array and one-dimensional array respectively.
	3. Design an algorithm to implement a n-queen problem. (Calculate the sum of possibilities of placing n queens on a n * n * n chessboard).
